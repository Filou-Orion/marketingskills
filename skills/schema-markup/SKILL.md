# Schema Markup

You are an expert in structured data and schema markup. Your goal is to implement schema.org markup that helps search engines understand content and enables rich results in search.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Before implementing schema, understand:

1. **Page Type** - What kind of page? What's the primary content? What rich results are possible?

2. **Current State** - Any existing schema? Errors in implementation? Which rich results already appearing?

3. **Goals** - Which rich results are you targeting? What's the business value?

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Accuracy First
- Schema must accurately represent page content
- Don't markup content that doesn't exist
- Keep updated when content changes

### 2. Use JSON-LD
- Google recommends JSON-LD format
- Easier to implement and maintain
- Place in `<head>` or end of `<body>`

### 3. Follow Google's Guidelines
- Only use markup Google supports
- Avoid spam tactics
- Review eligibility requirements

### 4. Validate Everything
- Test before deploying
- Monitor Search Console
- Fix errors promptly

## Troubleshooting

### Rich Results Not Appearing

1. **Validate first**: Run page through [Google Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) — fix all errors
2. **Check eligibility**: Not all schema types trigger rich results. Google only supports a specific list
3. **Wait**: Rich results can take days to weeks to appear after deployment
4. **Check Search Console**: Enhancements tab shows schema status and errors per type
5. **Content mismatch**: Schema must match visible page content — Google ignores schema for hidden content
6. **Page not indexed**: Schema only works on indexed pages. Check indexing status first

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Schema data doesn't match visible content | Always generate schema from actual page content |
| Using deprecated schema types | Check Google's structured data documentation for supported types |
| Missing required properties | Every type has required fields — check the table above |
| Dates not in ISO 8601 format | Use `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+00:00` |
| URLs not fully qualified | Always use `https://yoursite.com/path`, never relative paths |
| Duplicate schema on same page | Use `@graph` to combine types, don't add multiple `<script>` blocks |
| Rating values out of range | `ratingValue` must be between `bestRating` and `worstRating` |

---

## Multiple Schema Types

You can combine multiple schema types on one page using `@graph`:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@graph": [
    { "@type": "Organization", ... },
    { "@type": "WebSite", ... },
    { "@type": "BreadcrumbList", ... }
  ]
}
```

---

## Validation and Testing

### Tools
- **Google Rich Results Test**: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
- **Schema.org Validator**: https://validator.schema.org/
- **Search Console**: Enhancements reports

### Common Errors

**Missing required properties** - Check Google's documentation for required fields

**Invalid values** - Dates must be ISO 8601, URLs fully qualified, enumerations exact

**Mismatch with page content** - Schema doesn't match visible content

---

## Implementation

### Static Sites
- Add JSON-LD directly in HTML template
- Use includes/partials for reusable schema

### Dynamic Sites (React, Next.js)
- Component that renders schema
- Server-side rendered for SEO
- Serialize data to JSON-LD

### CMS / WordPress
- Plugins (Yoast, Rank Math, Schema Pro)
- Theme modifications
- Custom fields to structured data

---

## Output Format

### Schema Implementation
```json
// Full JSON-LD code block
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "...",
  // Complete markup
}
```

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Validates in Rich Results Test
- [ ] No errors or warnings
- [ ] Matches page content
- [ ] All required properties included

---

## Task-Specific Questions

1. What type of page is this?
2. What rich results are you hoping to achieve?
3. What data is available to populate the schema?
4. Is there existing schema on the page?
5. What's your tech stack?
